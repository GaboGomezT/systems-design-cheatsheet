# Approach During the Interview
In my humble opinion the Design Interview is meant to to gauge how well an individual can take on ambiguity. 

In other words, how well you can structure the unstructured.

A quick google search gives you these following steps,  which are what you will find most of the time.

* Step 1: Requirements clarifications.
* Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation.
* Step 3: System interface definition.
* Step 4: Defining data model.
* Step 5: High-level design.
* Step 6: Detailed design.
* Step 7: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

These steps are very helpful but, without some guidence, can be executed poorly. The idea is to approach these problems systematically but not mindlessly in a way that every decision you take is backed by some reasonable criteria.

### Step 1: Requirements clarifications

Getting the requirements for a design is about making a list of 3-5 functional requirements and maybe 2-4 non functional requirements. This is pretty straightforward.
